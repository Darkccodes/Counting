In short, you can use this repository's code for anything you like, as long as you 
follow the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 or later.

My understanding of the license is that you can distribute or modify the code as 
much as you like, but you must provide the bot's source code if you distribute it, 
you must retain and not modify license information or notices, any modifications 
must also be licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 or later
(or in some cases, a license that is compatible with AGPLv3), you must keep a 
list of changes made to the code, and anyone who interacts with the bot over a 
network is given a right to receive a copy of the bot's source code.

*This is not legal advice and is not the repository's license. Read the full license's 
terms before using the software.
